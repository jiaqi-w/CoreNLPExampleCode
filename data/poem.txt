I'm lost in the middle of my birthday.
I want my friends, their touch, with the earth's last love.
I will take life's final offering, I will take the human's last blessing.
Today my sack is empty. I have given completely whatever I had to give.
In return if I receive anything
some love, some forgiveness
then I will take it with me when I step on the boat that crosses to the festival of the wordless end.
